## 👤 About Me

I am a software engineer with strong expertise in frontend development and solid experience in full-stack and infrastructure engineering.  
My work focuses on building modern web applications with Vue/Nuxt and Laravel/Gin, while also designing and operating reliable home-lab and server environments.

This repository (**Malemow/Note**) serves as my personal knowledge base and
long-term documentation for development, infrastructure, and operations.

I am also an avid gamer, with a strong passion for the *Monster Hunter* series.

For me, gaming is more than entertainment — it is a way to:
- Relax after intensive engineering work
- Appreciate complex system and gameplay design
- Continuously care about performance, latency, and hardware tuning from a player’s perspective
